# Rocket League Custom Quickchat v1.5

Send your own custom quickchats in Rocket League on PC!

## About

Enjoy 8 new quickchats for Rocket League that are completely customizable. Decided to change a quickchat? Just use a hotkey to open the editor. And that's not all. Set your Rocket League video settings to Borderless and get an On Screen Display showing your quickchats. Open the CustomList text files and add as many chats as you'd like. When you activate Custom Quickchat in game, a random quickchat from the text file will be shown! Note: This is a macro so only PC players will be able to see custom quickchats.

## Opening/Closing the Macro

Start customqc.exe to run the macro. To exit the macro, right-click it's notification icon on the bottom right of the screen. Quickchats are only sent while Rocket League is in focus so to keep the macro running in the background, create a shortcut to customqc.exe and add it to the startup folder.
